# Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring

The goal of the project is to provide a robust system for road traffic monitoring using computer vision techniques for video analysis. 

## Week 1

On the first week the goal is to study the evaluation metrics needed for the system, in order also to be confortable with the data available. The metrics are:

* **Object Detection**:
 	* Mean Intersection over Union
    * Mean Average Precision

* **Optical Flow**:
    * Mean Square Error in Non-occluded areas
    * Percentage of Erroneous Pixels in Non-occluded areas
